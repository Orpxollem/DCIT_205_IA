            <h3>Spernova AI</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
                AI is already streamlining our daily life. But it’s also helping us understand one of the greatest mysteries humans have ever puzzled over: Space. 
                Increasingly, astronomers are using AI to help them discover and classify supernovae. 
                A supernova is the explosion of a star, and scientists have identified a number of different types – so each time a supernova is discovered, astronomers work to understand what type of colossal star explosion they’re looking at. 
                And AI is helping with this in several different ways
                Including… 
                <br>
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;">Automating the processes involved in detecting and classifying supernovae. AI systems can analyse the light curves of a supernova, which change in brightness over a period of time – and use this analysis to autonomously identify and classify that supernova. By streamlining this time-consuming process with AI, astronomers are able to study more supernovae and gain a more comprehensive understanding of space events.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;">Speeding up data analysis. AI is supporting rapid, efficient data analysis across almost every field of study – and astronomy is no exception. Faster data analysis means astronomers can understand supernovae and the properties and conditions associated with them more clearly – driving the emergence of new insights into the life cycle of stars.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;">Reducing the scope for human error. People make mistakes. But AI (when trained on high quality data sets) can minimise human error and enable more reliable, accurate data analysis. Astronomers involved in large-scale studies face immense volumes of data that are difficult to manage; and AI can ensure that data is processed effectively. 
                        And AI can collaborate with robotic telescopes
                        <br>
                        Interoperability between AI models and robotic telescopes enables them to work together to observe and gather data on supernovae.  
                        <br>
                        Robotic telescopes can rely on AI systems for automatic scheduling decisions, optimising observation time, and prioritising targets based on factors including predetermined scientific goals, or weather conditions. AI algorithms can also process the data collected by telescopes in real-time, cutting out the delay between data gathering and supernova identification. 
                        And advanced systems can fully automate the process to identify supernovae without any human intervention at all.
                        And one such AI-powered bot recently found a supernova
                        </li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;">This year, the astronomy community widely reported an exciting development in automated astronomy tech: AI has made its first autonomous detection, identification, and classification of a supernova. 
                        Through an international collaboration led by Northwestern University in the US, scientists created a tool which independently searches the sky for supernovas. It’s called the Bright Transient Survey bot (BTSbot) – and it requires no human intervention at all. It can perform in-depth observations of possible supernovae in order to enhance the efficiency (and accuracy) of the complex supernova classification process.
                        <br>
                        So it has the potential to enable groundbreaking discoveries about space
                        As with all AI applications, the quality of data is critical. And the complexity of supernova physics is hard to capture in AI models – with simplifications leading to inaccurate classifications. 
                        <br>
                        But recent developments show that there’s real potential for AI to enable groundbreaking discoveries in space. Scientists can use it to do many thousands of hours worth of study in a very short space of time. 
                        <br>
                        Which means that as AI models become more integrated into the field of astronomy, we’re on the cusp of discovering what’s out there – and here at DeepFest, we’ve no doubt that some incredible surprises will be found.

                <h3>What is New In Crypto Payments?</h3>
                <p>Quoting Anna Tutova (CEO at Coinstelegram) <br>
                    What Tutova said: <br>
                    
                    “Despite the bear market, the crypto payment space continues to grow, more companies, organisations and even government bodies start accepting crypto as a payment.” <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">What are crypto payments? </h4><br>
                    <p>
                    Crypto payments can be made using a range of different cryptocurrencies, including (but not limited to) Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. They’re processed through payment gateways which serve as payment processors for digital currencies, enabling merchants to accept crypto payments and instantly receive fiat currency in exchange.
                    Crypto payments are becoming more widely accepted – with Zippia reporting that around 15,000 businesses worldwide now accept Bitcoin. 
                    At LEAP 2023, Tutova spoke about how crypto payments are the next big thing. We asked her if she’s seen any notable development in crypto payments over the months since LEAP – and here’s what she told us. <br>
                    The crypto payments space has expanded this year <br>
                    “The crypto payments space has seen some intriguing developments recently, with Elon Musk's ambitious plans for X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk envisions transforming X into an ‘everything app’ with various functionalities, including a payment hub processor integrated into the social network. 
                    “To facilitate this, X's payment branch, Twitter Payments LLC, secured a ‘Currency Transmitter’ licence in Rhode Island, allowing them to store, transfer, and exchange digital assets on behalf of users. But it remains uncertain whether X will provide cryptocurrency-related services.
                    “In August PayPal announced the launch of its stablecoin PayPal USD, and recently it brought PYUSD to Venmo users too. PayPal's stablecoin launch signifies a major endorsement for the crypto realm, highlighting digital currencies' potential and possibly boosting their widespread adoption.
                    “Visa, a major payment institution, has also made strides in the crypto payments arena by exploring gas fee payments and facilitating direct crypto payments with USD Coin (USDC). They've embraced the Solana network for settlements and initiated pilot programs with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, offering clients the option of USDC stablecoin settlement instead of traditional fiat currencies.
                    “Additionally, e-commerce giant Shopify has integrated Solana Pay into its platform, enabling millions of merchants to accept crypto transactions, starting with USD Coin. Furthermore, Moneygram has unveiled plans for a digital wallet set to launch in early 2024, in collaboration with the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF). This non-custodial wallet will use stablecoins as a conduit for cryptocurrency on and off ramps, as well as for cross-border payments. 
                    “Moneygram's partnership with SDF, which began in 2021, has already facilitated the use of the USDC stablecoin on the Stellar blockchain for payments and incoming remittances. With the upcoming wallet, it will become even more accessible for individuals to convert and utilise digital assets – marking a significant step in the evolution of cross-border payments and cryptocurrency adoption.
                    And it doesn’t stop there: more public and private organisations are integrating crypto into their operations
                    Tutova added that:
                    The Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has enabled customers this month to use PayPal crypto to pay for driver’s licences, vehicle registrations, and other services.
                    The Singapore Red Cross started accepting crypto donations.
                    The fashion brand Ralph Lauren started accepting cryptocurrency payments at the newly opened store in Miami’s Design District.
                    In May Liechtenstein's Prime Minister, Daniel Risch unveiled the government's plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for select government services.
                    In February Brazil’s oldest bank Banco do Brasil enabled residents to pay their taxes using crypto.
                    Significantly, payment industry titan Mastercard has forged a partnership with leading experts in blockchain tech – “uniting forces to introduce the CBDC Partner Program.” 
                    And in June 2023, Mastercard unveiled its Multi Token Network (MTN) – “a suite of fundamental capabilities crafted to enhance security, scalability, and interoperability for transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems, with the aim of enabling more streamlined payment and commerce applications.” MTN is currently available in the UK, with plans to expand globally.”
                    Finally, Tutova said, “More countries started exploring CBDCs – now this number has reached 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP. A total of 11 nations have successfully introduced their digital currencies, while the European Central Bank is steadily progressing toward the commencement of its digital euro pilot program.”

                    <h3>Will open-source design help us move faster?</h3>
                    <p>Quoting Sebastien Gendron (Co-Founder and CEO at TransPod)<br>
                        What Gendron said: <br>
                        
                        “When we say easier to use, we mean bringing the frequency of the subway with the aircraft’s speed. In today’s world, intercity travel must be stress-free.” <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">What was he talking about? </h4><br>
                    <p>
                        What was he talking about? 
                        He was talking about the TransPod system for ultra-high speed travel.                         
                        On the blog this week we wrote about hyperloop transportation technologies. And in today’s newsletter we thought we’d dig a little into the history of hyperloop – and the ideas about high-speed travel that came before it. 
                        <br>
                        Transport loves an outlandish idea. 
                        There was the Aerotrain in 1965 – an experimental Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle, also known as a hovertain, that was developed in France. And as recently as 2020, the Transit Elevated Bus (TEB), proposed in China – a bus that straddles traffic by driving over the top of it, running on fixed tracks. 
                        <br>
                        And then there's the hyperloop. The conception of hyperloop is often attributed to Elon Musk’s 2013 white paper, but the idea is actually a lot older than that – with outlines and studies dating back three centuries.
                        <br> 
                        One of the first people to imagine a possible prototype of the hyperloop was George Medhurst – a British inventor in the 18th century. He pioneered the use of compressed air as a way to propel objects, and in 1799 he filed for a patent that could move objects through a system of iron pipes. 
                        <br>
                        Then there were experimental cargo stations 
                        In 1845, the London and Croydon Railway in the UK built an experimental cargo station. They created a vacuum between the train and the rails, which propelled the train forward via atmospheric pressure. 
                        <br>
                        The experiment was abandoned a couple of years later – but by 1850 pneumatic cargo railways were functioning in some parts of Europe. 
                        Then in the 1860s, the Crystal Palace atmospheric railway was constructed in south London, and it operated successfully over a short distance for a number of months, to demonstrate the potential of this technology. 
                        <br>
                        Air cushion tech and levitating pods came later
                        If you read Musk’s white paper, you’ll know that he credited Robert Goddard (American Rocket Scientist) as one of the first people to design a hyperloop. 
                        Published in 1909, Goddard’s article The Limit of Rapid Transit described a train that could travel from Boston to New York in just 12 minutes. That train never became a reality – but it outlined some of the foundational technologies for the hyperloop, including levitating pods and a vacuum-sealed tube. 
                        <br>
                        Attempts to build a transport system akin to the hyperloop came later – including the Aerotain that we mentioned earlier. And then in the 1990s, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began working on a vacuum-sealed tube train – but although they managed to build a test loop, the project was later archived. 
                        But the groundwork was in place
                        You could call them failed experiments. Or you could recognise all those concepts and attempts at building new transport systems for what they really are: part of the long process of developing a novel solution for high-speed travel, with each new inventor learning from the successes and mistakes of the last. 
                        In the 2000s, Daryl Oster (Founder and CEO of ET3 Global Alliance) designed a train in which pods the size of cars could travel along elevated tubes. It was patented in 1999 through an open consortium model, dedicated to the global implementation of tube transit tech. 
                        <br>
                        ET3 stands for Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies – which means a “network of tubes that have air removed to eliminate friction for magnetically levitated and driverless capsules”. 
                        And this formed part of the background for Musk’s Hyperloop Alpha, which proposed enclosed capsules or pods that would move through a system of tubes, on skis that levitated on an air cushion. 
                        Like Oster, Musk didn’t secure a patent for his design – instead choosing to register the design via the open-source project model. 
                        So more hyperloop developers began to emerge
                        After 2013, more companies stepped up to the hyperloop challenge: building teams dedicated to developing this technology and creating ultra-high speed intercity transport systems. We mentioned some of the companies still working on this in our new blog post – you can read it here. 
                        It’s likely that hyperloop transport will be a part of our future. 
                        But in the meantime, we’re feeling inspired by the journey this tech has taken so far: from early experiments with alternative transport systems, to open-source designs that enable tech innovators to learn from each other, and move more quickly towards a novel mode of transport.
