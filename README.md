About:
    This project is based on an Interim Assignment to create a 10 paged website of the Computer Science Department.

Set-Up:
    To work on this project, the following steps were taken:

    -> With the the use of the git terminal on my computer I cloned the DCIT_205_IA repository with the command:
         'git clone https://github.com/Orpxollem/DCIT_205_IA.git' into a selected location on my computer.

    -> After cloning the repository, I forked the repository as requested to enable me to be able to make changes to my files without affecting the files in the main repository.

    -> All files will be updated as I work on this project into the forked repository of the DCIT_205_IA repository and on completion of the project a pull request will be made to upload all my final files to the main repository
